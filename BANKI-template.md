## Behavioral

Most of the behavioral questions should be answered in the CAR format. At least three sentences for each question (one for cause, one for action and one for result). When answering begin with "At my last opportunity..." or "At my last company". Don't sell yourself out and say "bootcamp" or "school".

### CAR

- **Cause**
  - Why did you need to take action?
- **Action**
  - Steps you took so solve problem
  - Be positive
  - Don't be humble
- **Result**
  - How are you better?

### Questions

- [ ] Give me an example of a project or initiative that you started on your own. What prompted you to get started?

  - **Cause:** I had set of goal of losing 20 lbs and wanted to keep track of my progress throughout the year. 
  - **Action:** So I figured it would be a fun opportunity to research all the different fat-loss tracking methods and put it together in a web app so I could keep coming back to it every month.  
  - **Result:** This turned out to be something many others wanted as well and now about 70 to 200 people use estimatebodyfat.com everyday. The adsense revenue from the website helps pay for the server costs and even generates a little profit. 

- [ ] Tell me about a time you had to work on several projects at once. How did you handle this?

  - **Cause:** I was working on multiple policies for the Engineering and Project Controls Departments at the Toronto Transit Commission that required extensive research, data collection and validation. 
  - **Action:** I convinced my director to loan me an anaylst from a different team to help in the data collection and validation process as the number of policies that required to fit various by-laws grew. I would prepare detailed weekly guides of what was expected of the analyst. 
  - **Result:** In the end, my director was convinced that having a decidated analyst on our team would help speed the policy development and decided to create a full time position for that role. 

- [ ] Describe a situation in which you felt you had not communicated well enough. What did you do? How did you handle it?

  - **Cause:** I had an intern working with me when I was developing policies for the Engineering and Project Controls Departments at the Toronto Transit Commission that required extensive research, data collection and validation
  - **Action:** I explained to them what was required for the data collection and validation process and then left them to finish it.
  - **Result:** After a few hours I came to see what the final result was and found the templates were filled out incorrectly and there were a lot of holes in the research. To rectify the error, I decided to have a working session with the intern to show them exactly what was required and then worked with them to create an SOP so future interns and analysts have a detailed guide on reserach expectations.  
  
- [ ] Tell me about when you had to deal with conflict within your team. How was the conflict solved? How did you handle that? How would you deal with it now?

  - **Cause:** At my last opportunity, I was working with my Department Head in transitioning Project Controls Data (i.e. contract prices, forecasts, budgets) to the new PRISM system and as part of that transition, the DH wanted to replace the old data collection system by purchasing a new one in the open market as he felt the old one made collecting the data hard for the analysts.
  - **Action:**  While I agreed the old data collection system was inefficient, I proposed that we work with our IT team in rebuilding the current system to suit the analysts workload better. To prove my point, I build a mockup of what the future system would be like and then ran a poll amongst the end users (i.e., analysts) and they all prefered this upgrade instead of having to learn something new again 
  - **Result:** I then presented the results of the poll along with the new solution to my DH and upon seeing the results of the poll and the new design, he agreed that we should be rebuilding this data collection system in house instead of buying something entirely new.  

- [ ] Give me an example of a time you had to take a creative and unusual approach to solve coding problem. How did this idea come to your mind? Why do you think it was unusual?

  - **Cause:** Upon joining at my previous opportunity, I noticed many members of my team would produce monthly reports on various items that required a lot of manual data input. These reports were always time sensitive to the business and the anlysts were always running to get them complete 
  - **Action:** I decided to speak with them to see if I could help automate their taks via VBA or Macros thereby reducing their workload and helping them focus more on the analysis not on the manual data input.
  - **Result:** I spent an entire week documenting their task and another 2 weeks building a small program to automate about 60% of their workload. This helped free up their time to focus on more business senstive work 
 

- [ ] Describe a situation in which you worked diligently on a project and it did not produce the desired results. Why didn't you get the desired results? What did you learn from the experience?

  - **Cause:** At my previous opportunity, when I fined joined the team, I was assigned the task of building a data model that showed the linkage between the different policies on how they impact the various Engineering, Construction & Expansion Teams. My Supervisor knew this would take some time because of how scattered all the data sources were.  
  - **Action:**I however replied immeditely saying it would take just 3 days as I was trying to set a good impression on her. Well, coneecting all the data sources and building the model would actually take much longer and I wasnt able to deliver the project on time.
  - **Result:**In hindsight, I should have been more open and communicated that I would get back to her at the end of the day so I could first understand the scope of what is being asked of me. Luckily, my manager was kind enough to see that I was being sincere and worked with me to see it being complete. 


- [ ] Give an example of an important project goal you reached and how you achieved it.
  - **Cause:** At my previous opporunity, the department I worked has set a goal of becoming COR ceritifed (highest safety certification in Ontario, Canada) by as an Owner Orginization not a Constructor. This was a huge challenge because all the reference material was prepared for Contracting Companies not Owner Orgnizations. 
  - **Action:** I worked with the Manager - Safety & Secuity in developiing the roadmap, policy structure, staffing and staffing structure required to achieve this ceritifcation and presented this to the Chief Capital Officer. I worked with the safety analysts and construction safety officers in crafting policies to address all the challenges in the ECE Group   
  - **Result:**At the end of 4 years, the department has now closed all its gaps and is in the process of the final audit by IHSA and will end up being the first Owner-Orgnization with a COR certification. 


- [ ] Describe a situation in which you experienced difficulty in getting others to accept your ideas? What was your approach? How did this work? Were you able to successfully persuade someone to see things your way


  - **Cause:**At my previous opportunity, while working with team responsible for transioning the Project Controls section to PRISM, I requested access to existing data sources for contract information so I could work with Pricing Analysts to build the templates required for the transfer of data to PRISM. My dirctor at the time refused this request as she deemed it unneessary that I be given access to contract specific confidential information.
  - **Action:**I decided to hold a meeting with my Director and the Department Head and made a quick presentation expalining the need for my request and that it would help accelerate the easy transition of data from the current sources to PRISM.
  - **Result:**Once my director was able to understand the actual use of the data and its security, she autorized my access. 

 
- [ ] Tell me about a situation when you were responsible for project planning. Did everything go according to your plan? If not, then why and what kind of counteractions did you have to take?

  - **Cause:** Projects never go according to the initial plan. At my previous opportunity, I was responsible for developing the training schedule, planning the rollout and forcasting the time it would take to transition to the new software system for managing all the Project Controls data (schduling, budgets, contracts, forecasts). I made a presentation to the Department Head and the rest of the Project Controls team. 
  - **Action:** My schedule forcastted that we would be able to transition to the new system within 6 months and have the system up and runnining within 1 year. 
  - **Result:** Sadly, I underestimated how long the procurment process would take for being a government orginization which includes the testing and validation stages prior to the contract even being awarded. It was simply not a process of choosing the best avalaible software package and going with it. I learnt that when planning a project, it is important to consider the industry you are in, the regulatory envrionment that the industry functions in and the secruity and transfer of safety critical data requires probably double or even triple the time you initially allocate for it. 


- [ ] Tell me about a situation when you made a mistake at work. What happened exactly and how did you deal with it? What steps did you take to improve the situation?

  - **Cause:** At my previous opportunity, as the Project Manager for the Prism rollout for the Project Controls Section of the ECE Group, I scheduled the training of the super users as soon as the contract was signed so that they would get upto speed with the new software 
  - **Action:**The training sessions went off smoothly but the infrastructure was not setup for the super users to continue using the software after the training was completed. 
  - **Result:** It would take another 6 months before the software would be fully rolled out after which I was forced to rescshdule the training as most of the super user forgot what they had learnt. I learnt the importance of planning things all the way instead of trying to rush the process. The final training session with the Train the Trainers, Super Users and End Users was only scheduled when the entire infrastruce was setup. I also recorded all the training sessions to ensure there would always be training material for the end users. 


- [ ] Tell me about a time when you worked with someone who was not completing his or her share of the work. How did you handle the situation? Did you discuss your concern with your coworker? With your manager? If yes, how did your coworker respond to your concern? What was your manager's response?

Here is a helpful list of other reverse interview questions: [https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview](https://github.com/viraptor/reverse-interview)

## Whiteboard

When talking through a whiteboard problem or a coding challenge with an interviewer you should use the PREP method. (Don't write PREP in the actual interview, but use it now while doing codewars/leetcode). Going through this will help you engage with the interviewer (and possibly burn up some time 😉)

- **Parameters**
  - Inputs
  - Ask questions
    - Will it always be a number?
    - Will it ever be negative?
    - Any gotchas?
- **Returns**
  - Ask questions
    - Do you want it returned or is a console.log better?
    - Should I pass a whole array of solutions back or just a single solution?
- **Examples**
  - Show a couple black box examples, aka test cases
    - I pass in these arguments and get these results, is that correct?
  - Examples are a good idea because "you have the receipts" if the interviewer decides to change things.
- **Pseudocode**
  - Write pseudocode of each of the steps
